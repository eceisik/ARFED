# BARFED: Byzantine Attack Resistant Federated Averaging Based on Outlier Elimination

This repository is the official implementation of __*BARFED: Byzantine Attack Resistant Federated Averaging Based on Outlier Elimination*__. 
The framework and full methodology are detailed in [our manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04550).

## Install required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
for pip environment. OR

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To create a conda virtual environment from an environment.yml file. Please see [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) for more details.


## How to run

We performed the experiments for label flipping and Byzantine attacks on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.  We compared our results with the median method. The file name list for each data set is as follows. The default setting of experiments is NON-IID organized with a 20% malicious participant ratio.

| Dataset        | Attack Type        |    Method       | File Name             |
